                            <p>ESG ratings, as a metric for assessing corporate social responsibility, have garnered escalating interest from both domestic and international investors within China. However, critical indicators for augmenting ESG scores remain underexplored. Utilizing data from 2017 to 2020 on CSI 300 and CSI 500 constituent stocks, this study employs advanced machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost (XGB), LightGBM (LGB), and Random Forest (RF), to conduct a quantitative analysis of corporate feature values and their correlation with institutional rating outcomes. The findings indicate a predominant influence of corporate governance indicators, particularly in the realm of information disclosure, followed by social responsibility and environmental metrics. The paper further delineates specific, actionable short-term and long-term strategies that corporations can adopt across environmental, social, and governance dimensions, tailored to the nuances of various sub-indicators.</p>

                            <p>An adequate quantity and strategically designed layout of charging stations (CSs) are essential to mitigate "range anxiety" among electric vehicle (EV) users in urban settings. This study introduces a sophisticated multi-method optimization approach for the spatial planning of CSs, leveraging ArcGIS spatial data analysis tools and real-world trajectory data from online ride-hailing EVs in a prototypical Chinese city, referred to here as City A. Initially, ArcGIS is utilized to transpose the spatial demand for EV charging from ride-hailing services onto a standardized coordinate grid, derived from travel trajectories. Subsequently, the P-median model is employed to preliminarily identify potential CS sites, prioritizing minimal distance and maximal effective coverage. Thereafter, the attractiveness of these candidate sites to drivers is assessed through the Huff model, which considers variables such as population density, road network density, and passenger travel volume, to further refine site selection by minimizing overlap in service areas and construction costs. The process concludes with the Slacks Based Measure (SBM) super-efficiency model, which isolates the most efficient layout configuration. A case study in City A demonstrates that this optimized approach can halve the number of CSs required compared to traditional, unoptimized layouts. The methodologies developed herein offer a robust framework for city-level CS site planning under multiple constraints.</p>

                            <p>This study delves into the intricate relationship between chief executive officers' (CEOs') experiences of poverty and the digital transformation of their firms. Employing comprehensive data collection on CEOs' birthplaces and leveraging advanced text analytics to quantify digitalization, our analysis encompasses a wide array of listed companies in China. The findings reveal that CEOs' impoverished backgrounds exert a detrimental influence on their firms' digital transformation efforts, primarily due to a lack of motivation and social resources necessary for such initiatives. However, this adverse effect can be ameliorated when CEOs gain access to substantial social resources in later life. Our conclusions are robust, supported by rigorous testing, and underscore not only the impact of CEOs' early life poverty on corporate digitalization but also the potential for overcoming these challenges through the acquisition of external social resources and connections in adulthood. This study contributes significantly to existing literature and offers practical implications for enhancing corporate digital transformation strategies.</p>

                            <h4>Abstract</h4>
                            <p>As internet use becomes an important part of daily life, understanding its impact on psychological wellbeing and social connections is crucial. However, previous research has primarily focused on internet usage time, potentially overlooking the psychological significance individuals attribute to internet use. This study examines how both internet usage time and perceived internet importance relate to multiple dimensions of wellbeing and social outcomes in contemporary Chinese society. Using data from 14,940 participants in the 2022 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we investigated the relationships of these two aspects of internet engagement with happiness, life satisfaction, meaning in life, interpersonal relations, and social trust. Results revealed distinct patterns: while internet usage time showed minimal or slightly negative associations with outcomes, perceived internet importance demonstrated consistent positive relationships with wellbeing and social measures, particularly interpersonal relations. These associations persisted after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors. The findings suggest that in highly digitized societies, the psychological meaning attributed to internet use may be more consequential for wellbeing than actual usage time. By extending previous research predominantly focused on Western societies, this study highlights the importance of differentiating between behavioral and psychological dimensions of internet engagement in highly digitized societies. Implications for understanding internet use as a potential resource for well-being are discussed. Future research is encouraged to employ longitudinal designs to clarify causal relationships.</p>
